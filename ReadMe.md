**Traumatic Weather Bot** is a my own discord bot where I experiment and try to add new features

The prefix of this bot is: trauma

trauma ask "question" will ask the bot a question as of now the bot only answers when someone asks the weather. It analyses the sentence using NLP and checks for GeoPolitical Entity and tells the weather using the OpenWeather API
